            I’m a natural leader who lives by the philosophy of Carpe Diem, always seizing every opportunity to step up and make things happen within my organizations. Even as the youngest daughter, I’ve got the bravest heart of the bunch, though I’m just as happy finding peace in nature or recharging with a really good cup of coffee. At the end of the day, I’m just a fearless, caffeine-fueled trailblazer who knows how to balance a bold ambition with the simple joys of life.
